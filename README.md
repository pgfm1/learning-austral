# Learning Austral

My personal repository for learning [Austral](https://austral-lang.org/).

## Using This Repository

Copy the `standard` directory (the standard library) from the Austral source 
code into _this directory_. Subdirectories containing learning modules will 
reference it from this location.

```bash
$ cp -r ~/src/austral/standard/src ./standard
```
